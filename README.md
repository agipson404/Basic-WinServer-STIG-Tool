# 🛡️ Basic WinServer STIG Tool
 Created By: Arthur Gipson

**Basic WinServer STIG Tool** is a basic C# desktop application that audits and remediates key Windows Server security settings based on DISA STIG compliance. Built as a simple user-friendly GUI, it’s designed for system administrators who need a simple way to validate system hardening requirements.

## ✅ Features

- Graphical user interface (WinForms) — easy for non-cyber skill admins
- One-click system audit of:
  - Password complexity enforcement
  - RDP Network Level Authentication
  - Remote Desktop status
  - Guest account status (via `net user` command. I chose this to be compatible with .NET 8.0)
- Remediation of non-compliant items with one button
- Timestamped logs
- Export logs to `output/` folder as `.txt` files
- Manifest-enforced **administrator privileges**

---

## 💻 Requirements

- Windows Server 2016 / 2019 / 2022 (or Windows 10/11 for demo/testing)
- .NET 8.0 Runtime (WinForms Desktop)
- Must be **run as Administrator**

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Right-click → Run as Administrator**
2. Click **Run Audit** to view current security configurations
3. Review output in the log area
4. Click **Fix Issues** to apply secure settings
5. Click **Export Log** to save audit results to:
   ```
   ./output/Audit-Report-YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM.txt
   ```
